        <p class="hd">10 Exercises That You Can Do at Home to lose weight</p>
        <p class="set">When you’re working hard to get fit and lose weight, you want a regular routine that provides
            strong results.
            Good news: You don’t even need to become a gym rat; studies show that shorter periods of exercise are more
            effective for fat loss. But what kind of exercise burns the most calories? These exercises for weight loss
            will guide you in the right direction.</p>
        <div class="squats">
            <h2>1.Running</h2>
            <img src="pic11.jpg" alt="Squats">
            <p class="set">Whether you love or hate it, running is one of the best and simplest ways to burn calories—and you don’t
                need a treadmill to do it. Just lace up your shoes and hit the road. Running in intervals—speeding up
                and
                slowing down your pace—will help make the minutes and miles go by quickly. Run in fartleks, which means
                speedplay in Swedish, where you pick up the pace every other street lamp or water hydrant you hit, and
                then
                slow down after you pass the next one.</p>
            <p class="set">“The best way to burn calories while running is to vary your workouts,” says Natalie Dorset, a running
                coach
                in New York. “If you’re doing the same workout week after week, your body won’t have anything to adapt
                to.
                Vary the speed within a workout, do some bursts of faster running, but also mix up the types of runs you
                do.
                Whether it’s slow and steady, comfortable and hard, or intervals, variety is the key to constant
                adaptation.”</p>
            <p class="set">“Sprinting helps engage the core and offers shorter durations of runs at higher intensities,” Ryan adds.
                He
                also notes that running slow is relatively easy on your body as far as exertion is perceived, but
                running
                fast at 80% of your capability is even harder, pushing your body even more to its limits. This
                conditions
                your body to get used to this kind of stress. “There is definitely something to be said about getting
                comfortable being uncomfortable on your runs, so skip the road and head to a track or soccer field for
                some
                sprints next time,” he says.</p>

            <h2>2.Jump Rope</h2>
            <img src="pic12.jpg" alt="Push-ups">
            <p>If the last time you held a jump rope was in grade school, it’s time to get back into the swing of
                things.
                This calorie-busting workout can burn up to 318 calories (for a 140-pound woman) every 30 minutes—and
                your
                heart isn’t the only muscle that’s working hard.</p>

            <p>Jumping rope is a full-body workout. It fires up your quads and glutes to help you explode from the
                ground,
                and engages your core to keep you upright and stable as you land back down. Jumping rope also involves a
                little arm and shoulder action, as they remain tight while the rope movement comes from the wrists.</p>

            <p>“Jumping rope is a great way to burn calories while improving cardiovascular health, all-over-toning, and
                coordination, and it will help build power while lowering your risk of injury,” Dorset says.</p>

            <p>TRY this Crossrope routine: Start with 60 seconds of freestyle jump roping. You can jump with two feet,
                one
                foot, alternate, skip, or twist your hips. You can have some fun with this one. Next, put down your rope
                and
                do 30 seconds of mountain climbers. Return for 60 seconds of freestyle jump roping. End with 30 seconds
                in a
                plank. Rest for 2 minutes and repeat the cycle. Complete 3 rounds.</p>

            <h2>3.Kick-boxing</h2>
            <img src="pic14.jpg" alt="Lunges">
            <p class="set">Kickboxing is a great way to burn calories, sculpt muscles, and get in some serious stress relief! By
                driving power from your legs, your arms are able to throw major jabs, crosses, hooks and uppercuts,
                making
                it a full-body exercise. It will also test your coordination and endurance—all essential things that
                make
                you a better athlete in and out of the ring.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="squats">
            <h2>4.Spinning</h2>
            <img src="pic15.jpg" alt="Tricep-dips">
            <p>Spinning, whether it’s on an actual bike or a stationary one, is one of the best ways to burn calories
                and build endurance.</p>
            <p>If you don’t like running, spinning is a low-impact alternative that’ll crank up your heart rate.</p>
            <p>But there’s more to pushing the pedal than speed. By practicing good form and engaging your core as well
                as your thighs and glutes, spinning can be a full-body workout. Whether you’re doing a heavy climb in
                first position or sprinting in second, your core is the key to spinning efficiently and quickly. And as
                you drive your foot down with each stroke, it’s all about squeezing your inner thighs.</p>

            <h2>5.Rowing</h2>
            <img src="pic17.jpg" alt="Pull-ups">
            <p class="set">If you haven’t used your gym’s rowing machine, you’re missing out on one of the best pieces of cardio and
                strength equipment. Working your quads, glutes, hamstrings, core, arms, and back, you get a total-body
                workout that’ll have you pouring sweat. Contrary to what most people think, the power of rowing mostly
                comes from your legs—not your arms. Engaging your quads and glutes, you drive your legs back to pull the
                handle toward your chest.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="squats">
            <h2>6.Elliptical</h2>
            <img src="pic18.jpg" alt="Pull-ups">
            <p class="set">Don’t be fooled by the elliptical! It might look an easy machine, casually spinning your legs while
                watching TV or reading a magazine. But if you crank up the resistance and work at a hard pace, it’ll
                leave you breathless.Be sure to stand up straight to lengthen your abs and engage your upper-body muscles. Making use of the handles and swinging your arms
                will help you burn more calories.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="squats">
            <h2>7.Stair-Master</h2>
            <img src="pic19.jpg" alt="Pull-ups">
            <p class="set">No matter how fit you are, climbing up a flight of stairs is always a challenge. That's because steps are
                designed to be short so that you have to engage additional muscles, like your glutes, quads, and calves,
                to bring your entire body up.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="squats">
            <h2>8.Battle-Ropes</h2>
            <img src="pic20.jpg" alt="Pull-ups">
            <p>Battle ropes are an excellent, no-fuss way to get a full-body strength training and cardio workout.
                Working at a high intensity, battle ropes will increase your heart rate in seconds.</p>
            <p class="set">To use them properly: Hold one end of the rope with each hand and stand with your feet shoulder-distance
                apart. Bend your knees slightly and keep your chest up as you alternate whipping your arms to send waves
                down to the rope anchor. Experiment with different tempos and movement, whipping faster with one arm
                while slamming the rope hard with the other.</p>
