        <p class="top">When you’re working hard to get fit and lose weight, you want a regular routine that provides
            strong results.Good news: You don’t even need to become a gym rat. But what kind of exercise burns the most
            calories? These exercises
            will guide you in the right direction.</p>
        <div class="squats">
            <h2>1.Squats</h2>
            <p class="set">Squats are one of the most basic lower-body exercises for toning and strengthening the lower
                body, and they're frequently used in weight-gain workouts. You may graduate to more harder variations by
                adding
                weights once you've mastered the basic squat form.</p>
            <img src="squats.jpg" alt="Squats">
            <h3>How to do?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Standing tall with your back straight and your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart is a good
                    place to start. With your arms out in front of you, maintain a straight posture.</li>
                <li>Squeeze your glutes and move your butt backward rather than merely bending your knees.</li>
                <li>Start by inhaling, engaging your core, and bending your knees while pushing your butt out.</li>
                <li>Sit with your weight supported by your heels. Lower your hip joints till they are lower than your
                    knees. Because that's exactly what a full squat is.</li>
                <li>Keep your hands in this posture for three seconds.</li>
                <li>Exhale and begin to stand up, keeping your weight on your heels.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2.Push-ups</h2>
            <p class="set">Push-ups are a great exercise to start with if you're a novice. When it comes to
                strengthening the upper body, it is one of the most essential workouts for weight growth. Push-ups,
                above all, help you build muscle in your arms and shoulders.</p>

            <h2>3.Lunges</h2>
            <p class="set">Lunges, like squats, aid in the bulking and toning of your leg and hip muscles. It's one of
                the most effective ways to gain weight. You may also add weights or attempt various lunge variations to
                make the workout more tough.</p>

                weight. Dips might help you gain muscular growth in your upper body if done correctly. This workout can
